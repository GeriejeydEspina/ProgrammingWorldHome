                                Mobile app development refers to the process of creating software applications that run on mobile 
                                devices such as smartphones and tablets. It involves designing, building, testing, and deploying 
                                applications for various mobile platforms, including iOS (Apple devices) and Android (devices from 
                                various manufacturers).
                                Mobile app development can be native, where apps are built for a specific platform using languages 
                                like Swift or Objective-C for iOS and Java or Kotlin for Android. Alternatively, developers can use 
                                cross-platform frameworks like React Native, Flutter, or Xamarin, allowing them to write code once 
                                and deploy the app on multiple platforms.
